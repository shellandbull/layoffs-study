The data is mostly US based but I hope that it will grow in time\nThis site does a small statistical exploration on the dataset provided\nI used a small python script to do a .pdf export which I then converted to .csv\nI am open to receive contributions for something better as ideally we could connect this to a CI and have it self-update every day or so.\n\nsource: src/index.clj",

Add to that the common location for back offices, nearshoring & offshoring and you get very predictable groupings\nThe following chart has a logarithmic scale applied to it so be sure to hover on each bar to have a clear number of layoffs over the desired country\nIt makes perfect sense for the chart to look like this as it seems to follow a pattern where the larger the tech economy, the harder the layoffs.
