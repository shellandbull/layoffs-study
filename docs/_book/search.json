The dataset itself is limited to the first 1,000 entries due to limitations with the scraping tool I used.\nThe data itself, as a whole, can be made available to me such that this study self updates by way of a recurring job. But that can only be achieved if the owner of the Airtable grants me the access to.\nIf you are one of the authors of layoffs.fyi, I’d really like to speak with you. It’s a really hard time in tech and we, as a community, need to build the monitors in place so situations like this don’t catch up to us.\nAs for a tech stack, I decided to use a mash up between scicloj + quarto\n\n\n1.0.2 Results\n\nsource: src/index.clj",

The tech industry may encompass different sub industries from country to country.
