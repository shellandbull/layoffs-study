# layoffs-study

Following what's been some really hard years for tech. I built a study to showcase my data science skills attempting
to diagnose common denominators in mass layoffs within the tech industry

I'm using the [scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) stack for this.

The study primarily uses data from [https://layoffs.fyi/](https://layoffs.fyi/) but I intend to use other data sources in the future. 

Here's a list of the questions I am trying to answer with this study:

- What country had the most layoffs?
- What city where the company was HQ'd had the most layoffs?
- What industry within tech had the most layoffs?
- What company had the most layoffs?
- What's the split of layoffs across countries?
- What's the split of layoffs across cities?
- Is there a correlation between central bank announcements(e,g: rates stay the same) and layoff announcements?
- What's the split between core platform(most widely used programming language in the org) and # of layoffs?
- What's the split between PaaS platform(AWS, GCP, etc) and # of layoffs?
- What's the correlation between Glassdoor score & # of layoffs?
- What's the correlation between being a revenue vs investment funded business & # layoffs?

The list may grow but this is a very thorough set of things to go after
